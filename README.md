Precius is an Open Source Hardware and Software project designed for **Precision Cooking and Kitchen Automation for home cooks**. The project is funded and managed by [WEkigai](https://wekigai.eu). The first product in the series is [Precius Station](https://wekigai.eu/precius), a commercially available precision cooktop.

## What is Precision Cooking and why is it important
Coming soon!

## Vision and Guiding Principles
The project aims to create an eco system of open software and hardware designs for food preparation and automation for home cooks, funded by revenues generated by hardware sales and support.
The guiding principles of the project are:
- **Open** : The hardware and software designs shall be available openly for modifications and customizations by end users.
- **Unrestricted** : Commercially sold hardware shall be unencumbered with lock-ins, subscriptions or other financial or usability restrictions within the limits of product safety and liability.
- **Extendable, Repairable and Upgradable**: Within the constraints of design and supply chain, the products will maximize the ability for the user to extend, repair or upgrade their products.

## Roadmap

The project is based on a milestone structure with the following milestones currently defined.
The software and design development will continue in parallel on Github.

| Milestone | Type | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| Proof of principle | Development  | Completed in 2021  |
| Proof of concept | Development | Completed in 2024 |
| Publish on Github | Development | Completed Q1 2025 |
| First pre-commercial prototype | Development | Planned Q2 2025 |
| Setup signup list | Commercial | Planned Q1 2025 |
| Pre-manufacturing fundraising | Commercial | Planned Q2/Q3 2025 |
| Certification - alpha | Commercial |Planned Q4 2025 |
| Manufacturing - alpha | Commercial |Planned Q4 2025 |
| Alpha delivered| Commercial |Planned Q1 2026 |

## Why Open Source?
* Mainly because we believe it is the right thing to do. Cooking food is fundamental to our human nature and we believe improvements in cooking methods should not stay behind patents or lock-ins.
* We also believe that the purpose we want to achieve is beyond a single product, company or us as individual. It is a collective vision that can be realized to its fullest only by our collective efforts.
* We are not the silicon valley type. We are a small employee owned company with no external investors or shareholders (by choice!). We will remain employee owned and user driven rather than being driven by short term profit and *maximizing shareholder value*.
* We got a lot from Open Source and this is our way to say thank you.

## Our Business Model
We aim to generate revenue selling hardware based on this project and additional accessories (e.g. cookware, kitchen tools). In the future we may offer *optional* services (e.g. online downlaodable recipes) to generate further revenue. One of our inspirations is [Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com/), the company behind [HomeAssistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/).

## Contributing
We would be lying if we say we can do this without your help. Yes, you in particular! We know a lot about making products and running a business. But we do not know everything and do not have the resources to do everything on our own. 
No matter who you are, we are sure you can help us get further together. Some of the things you can help with:
* Think along with us (food, science, engineering, usability.....)
* Share your ideas
* Contribute to software development
* Contribute to mechanical and electronics design
* Help us spread this story via blogs, social media posts or email
* Copywriting
* Recipe ideas and testing
* Image assets
* 3D modelling (Blender and FreeCAD)
* ...
Have other ideas to help? Just [get in touch](https://wekigai.eu/contact).

## About WEkigai
**WEkigai** is a small company based in the Netherlands. The company is run by an engineer-scientist combo who apply their knowledge to make cooking easier and better.
